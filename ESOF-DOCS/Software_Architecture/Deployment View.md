#5. Deployment View
##5.1 Deployment View Introduction

The **deployment view** is used for describing the hardware components in which software components are deployed. Component and deployment diagrams are closely related: while the first ones describe the various components, deployment diagrams show how they are deployed in hardware.

The main purposes of deployment diagrams are:

* Visualize hardware topology of a system
* Describe the hardware components used to deploy software components
* Show communication relationships between hardware nodes
