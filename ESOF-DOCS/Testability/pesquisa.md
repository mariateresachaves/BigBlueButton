Unit Testing the Mobile Client
With the mobile client's development coming close to completion, the importance of unit testing is becoming increasingly important. Though not in the spirit of test driven development, the unit tests are being written after the core application. See the following link for general information about unit testing, specific information regarding the framework we are using to unit test the mobile client, and information about the current state of the coverage of the unit tests.

Members of our community periodically host stress tests for BigBlueButton, which gives others a data point on what a particular server was able to handle. Take any stress test with a grain of salt. There are many variables at play:

Server: CPU memory, disk space, and bandwidth
Usage scenarios (# of webcams and use of desktop sharing)
Upstream bandwidth from clients
Configuration of BigBlueButton
Version of BigBlueButton


We are continuously trying to incorporate more automated testing into the BigBlueButton development process, such as using TestNG.
