* have access to general **chat** or **make a private** chat with someone;
* **change the status icon**, so that others can see their current status;

* have **access to tutorials and FAQs** to understand how the system works.

The **Moderator** can:

* **make** a Viewer the **presenter**;
* **lock down other Viewers**, to ensure that other Viewers cannot become presenters;
* **(un)mute other Viewers**;
* **mute all except the presenter**. If a Viewer joins after the mute all option is activated, then that Viewer will be also muted;
* **lock user microphone**

The **Presenter** can:

* **upload files** and switch between files (if there's no upload the default file is a whiteboard)
* **start a poll** and choose the type. He has the possibility to **customize** it and after that he can **publish the results** or **cancel the poll** at anytime;
* **annotate on files** like a whiteboard;
* **share desktop**.

Below there's a use case diagram to represent the actions that the user can perform on the system.
