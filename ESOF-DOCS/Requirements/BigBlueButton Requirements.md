##2.1. Specification

<!-- Descrever os requesitos -->

The purpose of BigBlueButton is to bring access an high-quality online learning experience to every student with a web browser. There will be 3 kinds of users: 1) the *viewers*, who will usually be the students; 2) the professors or *presenters* who will be teaching; 3) the *moderators*, who will be in charge of maintaining the overall welfare of the presentation. In order to do this, certain requirements were needed for BigBlueButton to be able to achieve its purpose. 

* The *viewers* have to be able to get a clean and sleek interface, so that they can easily interact with the application. They also need means to participate in a presentation, whether if he wants to have a more laid-back, passive attitude (by giving means of just be able to listen and view the presentations) or a more active participation by providing the viewer with chat possibilities and also to interact with the presenter and the presentation itself.
* The *presenters* need to be able to easily transmit their knowledge to the viewers, whether by chat, audio and/or video messages, or even with the possibility of live video chat. It is also imperative to give them the possibility to upload demonstrative files of the subject they are presenting to help contextualizing, and also to edit them in real-time, in the case they want to make some extra annotations or to emphasize some particular detail in their uploads.
* The *moderators*
