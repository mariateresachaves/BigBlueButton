##1. Requirements Elicitation

<!-- serve só para contextualizar -->

##1.1. Description

Software development begins by specifying the respective project requirements. **The requirements elicitation** lies in colecting a set of short and consistent "sentences" from the users, customers and stakeholders which describe, without any kind of ambiguity, all the aspects of a system.

Understanding what the client actually wants or what he believes he needs (beyond other aspects like business or process rules) is a high priority issue. However this task is far from easy. In software engineering it's never clear which are the requirements based only on the users and customers description, since they have no clue about the project's complexity and other related issues.

In order to collect/discover their requirements there are useful **techniques** that will be discussed and described below.
