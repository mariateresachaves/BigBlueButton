##Introduction

BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system for online learning.
It looks forward to help students and teachers to collaborate through a web platform. They may share audio, video, presentation (with whiteboard markup), chat and the presenter's desktop in real-time. The users can assume different roles according to their purpose: a **viewer** (student) can chat and send or receive audio and video; a **moderator** can mute or unmute other viewers, lock down viewers, or make anyone (including themselves) the **presenter** that can upload slides and annotate them for all to see.
