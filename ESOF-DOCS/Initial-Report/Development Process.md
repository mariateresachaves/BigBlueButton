# 2. Development Process

## 2.1. Incremental Process

BigBlueButton it's a project comprised of a continuously growing community where developers, users, educational institutions, and commercial companies are all collaborating towards a more sophisticated software, but always bearing in mind the quality of the product. For that purpose, one of the main priorities taken in consideration when choosing the development process, was stability. To achieve the desired stability, BigBlueButton designed a development process based on multiple releases, wherein each step is built in a Waterfall cycle. To further guarantee the stability provided by the software, months are spent testing each release candidate before issueing a release. The motto of the BigBlueButton development process is *Release on quality, not dates*.

The development process is structured in 6 steps:

1. Planning
2. Design
3. Development
4. Beta Testing
5. Release Candidate
6. General Release

## 2.2. Advantages and disadvantages

One of the main advantages of this process in comparison with the Waterfall process, lies in the fact that, the last one will only have some commercial value when the project ends, as there is nothing pratical to be presented before this stage. The incremental process makes it possible to initially have a prototype of the project, verify the received feedback and some possible ajustments to be made, and continue to develop it based on this experience. By doing this process in a cyclical way, we guarantee that it goes according to project's target audience, and that when the final version is launched, it will be complete, with all the necessary ajustments already made.

The incremental process it's not agile compared to other development processes often used in open source projects. After the planning and designing of each release and the starting of the development stage, this process doesn't allow any changes to the previously agreed issues. It's necessary to wait to a future realese to add any new ideas to the project.
Usually the structural integrity of the code starts to crumble, and with each new addition the code can start to be obsolete.
