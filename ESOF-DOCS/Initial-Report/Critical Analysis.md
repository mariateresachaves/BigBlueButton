#3. Critical Analysis
BigBlueButton has a very active community. With 57 contributors on GitHub and a core development team of 6 people who is responsible for the core features development and overall quality of the project. The contributors of BBB are constantly helping and supporting each other and new developers. The forum and mailing list are constantly monitored and any new issue is quickly answered. Everyone who wants to contribute is welcome to the team and a very detailed documentation is provided to help the new developers. The BigBlueButton client is written in ActionScript and the server components are written in a combination of Java, Grails, and Scala.

Currently, the developers are working on the beta testing phase for the 1.0 release. The features stated on their documentation for the 1.0 release were already implemented, with the last one being the reconnection of the lost users during a live conference.
