# 3. Critical Analysis

## 3.1. Current state

BigBlueButton has a very active community with 57 contributors on GitHub and a core development team of 6 people who is responsible for the core features development and overall quality of the project.

Through the analysis of the GitHub repository, we can see that BigBlueButton reached its peak in contributions in late 2014 and 2015, which proves the impact that the project is presently having on the community. We can also see the extensive testing period for this project demonstrated by the far away dates in-between releases. For example, the last version (0.9) got a release candidate in September 2014, but was only accepted at the very end of April 2015. This proves what the original authors wanted, by extensively testing their releases to assure maximum quality on their product. The same happens in all previous releases.

The BigBlueButton's repository is managed by the following way: whenever a new feature is being developed or when a issue is reported, they are developed/fixed on their corresponding branch (e.g. *polling-module*). When these are ready, they are merged with the *development* branch, where it is further extensively tested. It is also integrated along with the other existing features. When these are finished without any issue, they are merged into the *master* branch, thus creating a new release.

Currently, the developers are working on the beta testing phase for the 1.0 release. The features stated on their documentation for the 1.0 release have already been implemented, with the last one being the reconnection of the lost users during a live conference. 

## 3.2. Positive Aspects

After studying all the provided documentation the positive aspects are:

  * The forum and mailing list are constantly monitored and any new issue is quickly answered.
  * Everyone who wants to contribute is welcome to the team and a very detailed documentation is provided to help the new developers.
  * The contributors of BBB are constantly helping and supporting each other and new developers.
  * Extensive testing period in-between releases.
  * Ensure maximum quality by following the stipulated goals and procedures.
  * Initially BBB hasn't created releases frequently enough so as to maximize development speed, automated builds are now created after each successful commit.
  * The BigBlueButton has separate streams for each release (in order to balance the need for stability), which are used to teach online classes and therefore requires the system to be stable.
  
## 3.3. Enhancements

In order to get familiar with BigBlueButton platform we tried out the web application and we suggest the following:

  * **Interface** - the user experience needs to be more appealing and consistent (e.g. display different clickable menus instead of display everything at the same time to the user)
  * **User Control System** - only the presenter may decide if any of the viewers may become presenters too or not; a moderator may determine a certain time that a student can be a presenter, pause the presentation, etc.
