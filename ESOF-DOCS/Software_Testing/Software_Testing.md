#14. Software Testing

##14.1 Overview
Software testing is any activity aimed at evaluating an attribute or capability of a program or system and determining that it meets its required results [*Hetzel, William C., The Complete Guide to Software Testing*]. Although crucial to software quality and widely deployed by programmers and testers, software testing still remains an art, due to limited understanding of the principles of software. The difficulty in software testing stems from the complexity of software: we can not completely test a program with moderate complexity. Testing is more than just debugging. The purpose of testing can be quality assurance, verification and validation, or reliability estimation. Testing can be used as a generic metric as well. Correctness testing and reliability testing are two major areas of testing. Software testing is a trade-off between budget, time and quality.

##14.2 Validation vs. Verification
The terms Verification and Validation are commonly used in software engineering to mean two different types of analysis. The usual questions associated whith each one are:
* **Validation:** Are we building the right system?
* **Verification:** Are we building the system right?

**Verificaton** is **defined** as the process of evaluating work-products (not the actual final product) of a development phase to determine whether they meet the specified requirements for that phase. Its **aim** is to ensure that the product is being built according to the requirements and design specifications. In other words, to ensure that work products meet their specified requirements. The **evaluation** items are: Plans, Requirement Specs, Design Specs, Code and Test Cases.
**Validation** is the process of evaluating software during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified business requirements. Its **aim** is to ensure that the product actually meets the userâ€™s needs, and that the specifications were correct in the first place. In other words, to demonstrate that the product fulfills its intended use when placed in its intended environment. The **evalution** item is the actual product/software.
