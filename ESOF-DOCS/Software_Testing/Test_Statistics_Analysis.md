#3. Test Statistics Analysis

BigBlueButton's testing phase is extensive, and one of the core development parts of the project. In this section we'll list some of the testing methods used by BigBlueButton's developers.

One of the important tests is the **stress test**, which consists in having an increasingly large number of users logging in the application and using it to see what is the server response to it. One of these tests results is shown in Fig.2
